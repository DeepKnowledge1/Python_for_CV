# 🔹 Chapter 3: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Computer Vision (Videos 15–19)

Welcome to the world of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** — the secret sauce behind professional-grade code in computer vision.

In this chapter, you’ll move beyond simple functions and start organizing your code into **classes and objects**, making it easier to scale, reuse, and test. We’ll walk you through everything from defining your first class to creating specialized tools using inheritance.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn in This Chapter

By the end of this chapter, you will:

✅ Understand what **OOP is** and why it's crucial for building robust CV tools  
✅ Know when to use **classes vs functions**  
✅ Define your own `ImageProcessor` class with attributes and methods  
✅ Use constructors to set default settings and initialize image data  
✅ Extend functionality using **inheritance** to create specialized processors  
✅ Complete a mini project where you build a fully functional image processor class

## 💡 Why This Chapter Matters

As your toolkit grows, managing everything with standalone functions gets messy. OOP lets you **group related logic and data together**, making your code cleaner, easier to debug, and ready for expansion.

This chapter sets the stage for the rest of the course — especially when you start building your CLI tool.

## 🚀 Bonus Tip: Plan Before You Code

We’ll show you how to sketch out your class design before writing any code — a pro trick that helps avoid rewrites later.
