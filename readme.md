- Loads a folder of normal training images
- Builds multivariate Gaussian models per feature map
- Detects anomalies in test images
- Saves visualizations of anomaly maps
- Integrates with the CLI tool (`cv_toolkit.py`)

#### Example CLI usage:
```bash
python cv_toolkit.py --input ./test_images --padim_train ./train_normal --output ./anomalies
```

#### 📂 File Structure:
```
cv_toolkit/
├── padim/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── extractor.py         # CNN feature extraction
│   ├── stats.py             # Covariance and Mahalanobis
│   ├── infer.py             # Full detection pipeline
│   └── visualize.py         # Heatmap generation
└── cv_toolkit.py            # Add new CLI flag: --padim_train / --padim_detect
```

### 🧪 Mini Project: Build Your Own CLI Image Toolkit

Create a full Python-based image processing tool that supports commands like:
```bash
python cv_toolkit.py --input ./raw \
                     --resize 256x256 \
                     --grayscale \
                     --add_scratches \
                     --output ./processed
```

You’ll build this from scratch using all the tools you've learned throughout the course — OOP, preprocessing, augmentation, performance optimization, and more.
