## 🎯 What You'll Learn in This Chapter

By the end of this chapter, you will:

✅ Use **variables** to store image paths and metadata  
✅ Work with **lists, tuples, and dictionaries** to manage batches of images  
✅ Apply **if statements and loops** for conditional and batch image processing  
✅ Create **functions** that encapsulate common image operations  
✅ Understand how to **read and display images** using both OpenCV and Pillow  
✅ Complete a mini project where you resize multiple images using a function  
✅ Take a short quiz to reinforce your learning

## 💡 Why This Chapter Matters

Even if you’ve written some Python before, applying it to **real-world image problems** is a different ball game. In this chapter, every concept is taught with **practical, visual examples** so you can see how Python code directly affects pixels on the screen.

You’ll also build a habit of writing **clean, reusable code** from the very start — a skill that becomes essential when building your final toolkit.

## 🚀 Bonus Tip: Think in Batches

One of the biggest mistakes beginners make is processing one image at a time. We’ll show you how to use **loops and functions together** to automate tasks across hundreds of images — saving you hours in the future.

## 👉 Next Up

In the next chapter, we take your Python skills to the next level by introducing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** — the key to writing clean, scalable, and maintainable code for complex image pipelines.
